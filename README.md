# 📝 TodoApp

A simple web application built to learn **Spring Boot**, **Spring MVC**, and **JSP**.  
This project allows users to manage tasks (TODOs) and demonstrates how controllers, services, and server-side views work together in a traditional MVC setup.

> 🧠 **Note:**  
> This project follows a **classic Spring MVC (JSP)** architecture, commonly found in *legacy enterprise applications*.  
> It is intended purely for **educational purposes** — to understand the fundamentals of MVC before moving on to modern approaches using **REST APIs** and separate frontends (React, Angular, etc.).
