📝 TodoApp

A simple web application built to learn Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and JSP.
It allows users to manage tasks (TODOs) and demonstrates how controllers, services, and server-side views work together in a traditional MVC setup.

🧠 Note:
This project follows a classic Spring MVC (JSP) approach, commonly found in legacy enterprise applications.
It is intended purely for educational purposes — to understand the MVC architecture before moving on to modern approaches using REST APIs and separate frontends (React, Angular, etc.).
